<h1>Hi, I'm Karen! <br/>Software engineer for corporate by day, tinkerer by night 💫🌱⚙️</h1>
<p>I would love to show you what I've built as a budding software engineer but most of it is propietary to the company I currently work for. So instead of regurgitating my resume here, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-a-wu/">you can read about it on my LinkedIn.</a> TL;DR: Full Stack Development (React, Java, JavaScript, and HTML+CSS), AI (Generative AI, Prompt Engineering, Python, OpenAI, LangChain, and FAISS), HCI, and Data Analytics. Looking to dive deeper into game development.</p>
<h2>Here are some personal, side projects I'm working on. Nothing crazy, very much for fun.</h2>
